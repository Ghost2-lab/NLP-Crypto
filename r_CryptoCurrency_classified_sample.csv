About 93% of all traditional financial assets that have been brought onchain are on Ethereum:

More than half of all the value in DeFi is on Ethereum, about 2/3 if you include it's rollups:

Transfer volume is the amount of $ moved correct? Not the amount of transactions... If that's the case, volume is meaningless. Transactions is meaningful. Also, price per transaction is more meaningful. As is speed of transaction (finalisation). Volume is a pretty moot metric. It only goes to show how many rich people are using it, not how much it can actually handle.

The fact that Eth requires a community to be enticed to decentralise is telling. A proper crypto should have built within it incentives for  decentralision. ""C'mon guys, let's decentralise"" is not a trustworthy solution by any means.

What you're saying is somewhat true regarding the drawback of PoW but also the argument applies even moreso to PoS.

But you have to consider that PoS is inherently centralising. Over time, the rich get richer faster as a function of how much they own, not how much they are contributing. This is a super important distinction. PoW allows anyone anywhere there is energy to contribute to decentralisation. There's a fundamental issue there that is important to think about. Yes, rich do get richer, but they still have to produce real *work* to make it in PoW, regardless of how much they ""have"". In PoS, the money makes itself.

And when comparing archaic tech like BTC, yes, you have some issues with decentralisation.

But BTC's limitations are based fundamentally on the block rate. Because a block can only be mined every 10 minutes, you essentially *need* mining pools. Not good! I would agree.

The crypto that will take over Eth will have much higher blockrates. Let's say 10-100 blocks per second. This would allow most average people with a mining rig to hit a block while solo mining. It would also incorporate purging to keep the size reasonable.

So let me add to my list:

- Must have very high BPS to encourage solo mining and decentralisation
- Must be able to purge the history while keeping the state in a way that doesn't affect decentralisation.",Graineon,1,05/12/2024 14:43,Here’s how Ethereum is getting ready for the $4k mark ,here ethereum getting ready k mark,stablecoin transfer volume ethereum ecosystem last year high visa high mastercard transfer volume amount moved correct not amount case volume meaningless meaningful also price per transaction meaningful speed transaction volume pretty moot metric go show many rich people using not much actually handle there chain multiple client running making impossible capture impossible bug stop org pow mean rich entity benefit economy scale inevitably end building block block builder responsible bitcoin block fact eth requires community enticed telling proper crypto should built within incentive cmon guy let not trustworthy solution mean saying somewhat true regarding drawback pow also argument applies even moreso po consider po inherently time rich get richer faster function much not much super important distinction pow allows anyone anywhere energy contribute there fundamental issue important think yes rich do get richer still produce real work make pow regardless much po money make comparing archaic tech like btc yes issue btcs limitation based block rate block mined every minute essentially need mining pool not good would agree crypto take eth much higher blockrates let sayblocks per second would allow average people mining rig hit block solo mining would also incorporate purging keep size reasonable let add list must high bps encourage solo mining must able purge history keeping state way not affect,"['here', 'ethereum', 'getting', 'ready', 'k', 'mark']","['stablecoin', 'transfer', 'volume', 'ethereum', 'ecosystem', 'last', 'year', 'high', 'visa', 'high', 'mastercard', 'transfer', 'volume', 'amount', 'moved', 'correct', 'not', 'amount', 'case', 'volume', 'meaningless', 'meaningful', 'also', 'price', 'per', 'transaction', 'meaningful', 'speed', 'transaction', 'volume', 'pretty', 'moot', 'metric', 'go', 'show', 'many', 'rich', 'people', 'using', 'not', 'much', 'actually', 'handle', 'there', 'chain', 'multiple', 'client', 'running', 'making', 'impossible', 'capture', 'impossible', 'bug', 'stop', 'org', 'pow', 'mean', 'rich', 'entity', 'benefit', 'economy', 'scale', 'inevitably', 'end', 'building', 'block', 'block', 'builder', 'responsible', 'bitcoin', 'block', 'fact', 'eth', 'requires', 'community', 'enticed', 'telling', 'proper', 'crypto', 'should', 'built', 'within', 'incentive', 'cmon', 'guy', 'let', 'not', 'trustworthy', 'solution', 'mean', 'saying', 'somewhat', 'true', 'regarding', 'drawback', 'pow', 'also', 'argument', 'applies', 'even', 'moreso', 'po', 'consider', 'po', 'inherently', 'time', 'rich', 'get', 'richer', 'faster', 'function', 'much', 'not', 'much', 'super', 'important', 'distinction', 'pow', 'allows', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'energy', 'contribute', 'there', 'fundamental', 'issue', 'important', 'think', 'yes', 'rich', 'do', 'get', 'richer', 'still', 'produce', 'real', 'work', 'make', 'pow', 'regardless', 'much', 'po', 'money', 'make', 'comparing', 'archaic', 'tech', 'like', 'btc', 'yes', 'issue', 'btcs', 'limitation', 'based', 'block', 'rate', 'block', 'mined', 'every', 'minute', 'essentially', 'need', 'mining', 'pool', 'not', 'good', 'would', 'agree', 'crypto', 'take', 'eth', 'much', 'higher', 'blockrates', 'let', 'sayblocks', 'per', 'second', 'would', 'allow', 'average', 'people', 'mining', 'rig', 'hit', 'block', 'solo', 'mining', 'would', 'also', 'incorporate', 'purging', 'keep', 'size', 'reasonable', 'let', 'add', 'list', 'must', 'high', 'bps', 'encourage', 'solo', 'mining', 'must', 'able', 'purge', 'history', 'keeping', 'state', 'way', 'not', 'affect']",ETH,Negative

It's worth remembering that you don't actually need to buy anything to learn. 

A good place to start is: https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons 

Completely free and it will teach you the basics of how crypto works, how wallets work, how to keep your assets safe, and loads of other stuff.

You can set up wallets for free, connect them to testnets and try out things like transferring tokens, recovering seed phrases etc. None of that will make you any money, but it will give you some knowledge to help avoid losing money in the future.

Once the market goes down again, maybe in a couple of years, you will know exactly how to use crypto and will have saved up a stash of stablecoins. Everyone here will be moaning about how the coins they bought for $4,000 are only worth $800, and you will be happy to buy them for an 80% discount!",MinimalGravitas,4,05/12/2024 09:22,"I am new any advice?

What a lot of noobs don’t understand, most don’t lose their money from being late and buying the top. They lose money by DCAing into “a falling knife”, didn’t have the right time horizon expectation to expect a recovery, and then capitulate at the bottom. 

Instead of just blindly DCAing into things you don’t understand because of FOMO, take your time to learn and put your money away in a safe place. Start buying only when you feel confident enough in knowing what you are buying.

Also, AVOID USDT at all cost. Use USDC instead. Money is made in the waiting and be patient.

Archipelag0h,1h744cs,Nervos to build Layer 2 on Doge,"Announcing in the previous week, Nervos is working on bringing its layer 2 protocol RGB++ to Dogecoin. With initial plans for a memecoin launchpad built on DOGE. With also bringing the possibilities associated with DOGE now being connected to BTC through RGB++

RGB++ has been receiving a lot of interest recently from both the Bitcoin and Asian crypto communities after having first being built for Bitcoin and its very novel approach of 'Isomorphic binding' which requires no actual bridge to the other chain but rather, mapping 2 chains along side each other.

**Quote from recent Techflow article:**

>It is reported that RGB++ will support the $Doge chain in the next step, and will launch the Meme launchpad on the Doge chain after the launch of BTC Meme launchpad. At the same time, he also said that the lightning network is the strategic direction of CKB's long-term layout, which will greatly increase the competitive advantage of the RGB++ protocol. It is worth noting that at present, many teams are not only focusing on the development of the protocol itself, but also promoting the compatibility of their protocols with lightning networks, such as Taproot Assets and RGB. Up to now, RGB++ ecological Meme leading coin SEAL has risen by 50% in 24 hours, and CKB has risen by 12%.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and the other chain to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to the other chain without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

Excuse me while I deep dive this info haha",imaducksfan,1,04/12/2024 22:56,"Coin ranking overtime website  I was wondering if any of you know of a website that tracks the coin ranking of each coin over time. I have been trying to use the big websites for marketcap but none of them seem to keep track of if a coin goes down or up in rank 

For example:

XRP is the 3rd ranked cryptocurrency right now but what rank was it November 3rd 2020? 

I’m looking for any website that has that sort of information 

I feel like there’s a lot of value in seeing where coins were ranking at certain times of the year, right now that best I can do is right it down and check every month to see if my coin gained rank or lost rank 

Or any ideas on how I might be able to track these things easier? All thoughts and contributions are welcome!

Regarding ZK. ZK serves for 2 things: privacy and compression. ZK can help decentralized systems to scale (zk coprocessors, commitments, etc) or for privacy (noir, etc). It's a tool that can be used to help decentralization but not the main tool.

Ironically, if you consider client market share as a crucial factor in decentralization, [Bitcoin fails with a 98% supermajority in Bitcoin Core](https://coin.dance/nodes), whereas [Ethereum recently has overcome its client supermajority risk.](https://supermajority.info/)

The Ethereum community has been working diligently towards decreasing supermajority risk over the past few years and the campaign has worked, whereas I haven't really seen the Bitcoin community even caring about mitigating this risk. Of course, it may be because Satoshi himself did not think the network could even support client diversity on a technical level:

>I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.

Client supermajority is often overlooked because it's a technical detail, but is highly important to decentralization because it can be a single point of failure for the entire network. That's why I wouldn't even consider a protocol decentralized until there are at least 2, ideally 3, opensource client teams, regardless of number of nodes.

There are of course other factors beyond client supermajority:

* what % of Bitcoin/Ethereum nodes are running on AWS?
* what % Bitcoin hashpower is controlled by pools?
* what % of Ethereum ETH validators are controlled by pools?",jventura1110,7,04/12/2024 20:33,"What is the most decentralized protocol?

One of the most important (and misunderstood) factors in decentralization is how dependent a project is on its original foundation for development - i.e. if the founder and team disappeared, could the community carry on the work. This cannot be measured by node count or voting distribution.

Of course, Bitcoin is fully independent of its original foundation and founder.

Ethereum is getting there. There’s a broad community of contributors spread across different organizations. The Foundation still maintains a plan of record, but since the Merge and Dencun upgrades, the layer 1 platform is now sufficiently established. The next big advancements will come from Layer 2 innovation and Dapps.

Few people in crypto really understand how important Ethereum’s multi-layered model is. No other blockchain has any serious layer 2. Some of the less technical crypto bros will argue that their favor L1s are so fast that they don’t need Layer 2. This is a delusion. 

The purpose of Layer 2 isn’t just about speed, it’s about a system of continued independent development that’s not dictated by a central foundation.

That’s why Ethereum is so dominant - it and its L2s account for 5 of the top 10 chains by activity. Nothing comes close.",admin_default,2,05/12/2024 00:39,"What is the most decentralized protocol?

There are many different metrics.

* Most decentralized development: Ethereum. No other blockchain has 10+ client teams and gets inputs from the user community and dapp community
* Lowest hardware requirements for full nodes: Bitcoin, though there are some smaller blockchains with lower requirements or that use thin clients. Unfortunately Bitcoin's consensus protocol is very centralized due to large mining pools having near-complete block-production power.
* Highest sybil resistance: Maybe Hedera. Its Nakamoto coefficient is very high. Cardano's is also high, but I know from experience that many delegator entities are actually run by the same operators
* Token distribution: none of them?

This is a very stupid question because decentralization is not an end in itself. ETH maxis gets so hung up about ppl can run Raspberry Pi nodes so it makes them look closer to Bitcoin. Ask yourself how many institutional Bitcoin buyers are excited to twap Bitcoin because they can't afford nodes beyond Raspberry Pis?

Decentralization is not an end, but a means to an end. That is to secure a permissionless and censorship-resistant network from liveness failures and attacks.

I've worked in universities. If there's money inflow it can easily be justified, and given their department has received IOG money, it's not unnatural for it to be biased. I'm not saying their peer reviewed papers are. But that it's not a good representation as it only looks at block data.

Which is one dimension, but by no means representative and not a particularly important one at that. Your system can have a million independent nodes, but unless they are all creating blocks, in most cases they are just passively following a chain, often being created by a few central players.  That's decentralised in one dimension but centralised in another dimension.
